"""Discussion Questions

1. What are the three main design advantages that object orientation
   can provide? Explain each concept.

- abstraction: hiding unecessary details
- polymorphism: allowing data structures to be replicated with varying differences 
- encapsulation: keeping all relevant data together


2. What is a class?

A class is a template with which one can create several instances. 
Each instance inherits attributes and methods from the class from which it was created, allowing similar 
    information to be stored in separate but related structures.


3. What is a method?

A method is a function that takes place within a class or instance, using attributes


4. What is an instance in object orientation?

An instance is a replica of a class that inherits attributes and methods from that class. 
Data specific to that class can be manually changed or added via instance attributes and methods

5. How is a class attribute different than an instance attribute?
   Give an example of when you might use each.

A class attribute is stored data that will be passed down to each instance of that class
An instance attribute is data that will pertain to only that instance, and no other instance of that class
